{"name":"Background Particle Generator","tagline":"Generates particles for website backgrounds. View example at http://dfred.me","body":"# Look at particles.html for an simple example of how to implement this.\r\n# How to use:\r\n1. Create a canvas with the id #space, the particles are going to generate in it. The generator automatically expands it to full page with and height with x-index or -1. \r\n2. Add script to page after canvas is loaded. ex:\r\n`        <canvas id=\"space\" onload=\"startCanvas()\">\r\n            Error with canvas...\r\n        </canvas>\r\n        <script src=\"particle.js\"></script>`\r\n3. Add the css file to the header.\r\n4. modify the javascript file for your needs\r\n\r\n# Values\r\nAt the start of the js files, multiple values can be modified\r\n## density\r\nthis changes how many particles are present on the canvass proportional to the area of the canvas.\r\n## lineColor\r\nthis changes the color of lines that form between points.\r\n## particleColor\r\nthis changes the color of particles on the canvas (the round things that move).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
